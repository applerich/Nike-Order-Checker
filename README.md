# Nike-Order-Checker

Easier way to check multiple Nike.com orders.

*Requires Python 2.7 and Requests

### Setup

1. Store orders in "orders.txt" in email:ordernumber format with one order per line
2. Store proxies in "proxies.txt" in ip:host or ip:host:user:pass format with one proxy per line
3. If not using proxies and checking a large number of orders, feel free to edit the DELAY in main.py
4. Run main.py
